## Overview
Our cryptocurrency monitoring website is a web-app dedicated to monitoring the prices of mainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. It obtains the real-time prices of each cryptocurrency via the Coinbase API and displays the data in a line chart which shows the price for that currency for the last 30 days. Each of our supported currencies (currently 3) will have their own chart on the main page. Visitors can also add or remove charts on their page if they want (the changes will not persist). In addition, users can also subscribe for an email notification if the price of a particular currency has passed over or below a given threshold that they will provide.
