        <h3>Project idea</h3>
        <p>
          As cryptocurrency becomes a new trend for investment, its unpredictability
          has caused a lot of troubles for buyers. Our project will build a
          website dedicated to monitoring the prices of mainstream cryptocurrencies
          such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Users can choose one or multiple
          cryptocurrencies and the website will display their price in real-time. 
          We will use graphs to help visualize the displayed data and the graphs will update in real-time as well.
          Users can also sign up for emails so that they can get notified if the
          price of a cryptocurrency crosses a threshold that they have set.
        </p>

        <h3>API/Dataset</h3>
        <p>
          We will use Coinbase as our public API to gather cryptocurrency prices (https://developers.coinbase.com/)
        </p>

        <h3>Data to be pushed to client</h3>
        <p>
          Our server will continuously poll our crypto API and when it detects a change in price in any of the currencies we support, it will broadcast this price change via websockets to all clients who subscribed for updates for that particular currency.
