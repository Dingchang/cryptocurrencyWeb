        <p>
          As cryptocurrency becomes a new trend for investment, its unpredictability
          has caused a lot of troubles for buyers. Our project will build a
          website dedicated to monitoring the prices of mainstream cryptocurrencies
          such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Users can choose one or multiple
          cryptocurrencies and the website will display their price in real-time.
          Users can also sign up emails so that they would get notified if the
          price of a cryptocurrency crosses a threshold they set.
